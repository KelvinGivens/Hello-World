# Hello-World
This is my first repository.
A few things about myself, I am 22 years old. I am a musician. My hobbies include writing and preforming music, reading, thinking, etc. 
I started college at Richland community college in dallas as a music major and then transfered to Texas State as an advertising major with a minor in English. I havent finished school yet but I plan to return soon to finish a bachelors degree.
INTP/ENTP depending on who or what I am around. 
I would love to move to California by 27.
